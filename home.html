                    <p>
                        Automation Industry Association (AIA) is committed to be a vibrant forum for all automation companies in India spreading knowledge and creating awareness levels that make a vital difference to the global competitiveness of Indian industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        IITD and AIA have jointly set up a fully integrated Smart Manufacturing and Learning Facility for discrete and hybrid manufacturing segments such as Automotive, Consumer Durables and Processed Foods, etc. These segments are fast growing and compete with global brands on Innovation, Quality and Customer loyalty. A demo cum experience facility in North India, supported by extensive skill building, MSME consultancy, multi-academia partnerships and research, has given a huge fillip to the competitiveness of Indian Manufacturing. The project imbibes technologies from Europe, Japan, USA and India.

The ‘Connected Enterprise Maturity Model’ for implementing a more intelligent OT/IT network, has proven to provide significant reductions in costs and improved capabilities. Rockwell Automation developed this five-stage maturity model that incorporates measures and best practices necessary to ensure effective change in both, technologies and organisational cultures.

                <h3>Industrial IOT and Cyber Physical Systems</h3>
                    <p>
                    Traditionally, manufacturing has been considered as a process that convert raw materials into physical products in the factories by managing resources with best automation practices available.
    
    Today, drivers such as technology, sustainability, optimization and the need to meet customer demands have once again encouraged the transformation of the manufacturing industry to become adaptive, fully connected, and aware of its own power quality. One of the most significant trends in manufacturing is of improved information technology solutions involving the union of conventional automation with the information technology.

                    <h3>Advanced Simulation and Digital Twin</h3>
                    <p>
                        The digital factory concept offers an integrated approach to enhance the product and production engineering processes and simulation is a key technology within this concept. 
Simulation helps to create digital models of products, production systems, logistic systems so that one can explore a system’s characteristics and optimize its performance. These digital models have the ability to run experiments and what-if scenarios without disturbing existing production systems or – when used in the planning process – long before the real production systems are installed. Extensive analysis tools, such as bottleneck analysis, statistics and charts give us an opportunity to evaluate different manufacturing scenarios.

            <h3>Wireless Instrumentation</h3>
            <p>
                Wireless products have fundamentally changed our lives – and they are also playing an increasingly important role in the industrial environment. Here too, the enormous potential of wireless technology opens up totally new perspectives. 

In the new connected world of smart manufacturing, industrial wireless instrumentation is rapidly becoming the technology of choice for a growing class of applications. It is quickly gaining relevance in automation applications. In some applications, it is not the amount of data that poses challenges, but the distances to be bridged. Whenever the plant architecture does not allow conventional wiring, values are only accessible through frequent visits to the field. Wireless instrumentation can be a solution to one such problem.

                <h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
                <p>
                    A key component in making Industry 4.0 a reality are machines that can produce the desired components faster, more flexibly and more precisely than ever before. Also Consumers want products that reflect their individuality. 

Moving away from traditional brand loyalty, they prefer loose relationships with multiple suppliers who can provide increasing levels of product personalization, from fashion and apparel to home ware and furniture, from automobiles to fast-moving consumer goods. To drive this interaction, consumers are accessing ever more intuitive websites to move back along the supply chain, becoming part of the product design function of a business and providing design intent for products that have yet to be manufactured.
